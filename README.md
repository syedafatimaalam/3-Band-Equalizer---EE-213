FILTERS
1. Objective
The aim of this project is to:
• Design and implement an active or passive filter circuit that addresses a real-world signal processing application through effective frequency response control.
• Evaluate and validate the designed system using analytical calculations, simulation tools, and hardware testing to compare theoretical and practical performance.
• Address complex engineering elements such as multiple constraints, trade-offs, and system integration.
• Demonstrate engineering judgment and communication skills by analyzing the design constraints, presenting results, and documenting the complete project process.

This is a Complex Engineering Activity, and it includes the following Washington Accord (WA) attributes:
2. Code Activity Characteristic
-EA1 Range of Resources – Use of diverse, possibly specialized, resources.
-EA5 Familiarity – activities involve unpredictability and require judgment and responsibility

3. Description
This project aims to engage students in solving a Complex Engineering Problem (CEP) by designing, implementing, and analyzing a hardware-based filter circuit that demonstrates a real-world application. Students will apply their understanding of circuit theory, frequency response, and filter characteristics to create a functional prototype and evaluate its performance. Projects should go beyond textbook examples and demonstrate critical thinking, creativity, and integration of multiple circuit concepts.

5. Deliverables
The expectations from the project are that students develop a system based on the application of filters keeping the following deliverables in mind:
1. Identify a real-world problem that can be addressed through a filter-based circuit (e.g., signal conditioning, noise suppression, audio enhancement, biomedical filtering, sensor interfacing, etc.).
2. Design and Calculations: Select the type of filter that fits your problem — low-pass (allows low frequencies), high-pass (allows high frequencies), band-pass (allows a range), or band-stop (blocks a range). Decide whether it should be passive (using only resistors, capacitors, inductors) or active (using op-amps for amplification or control). Perform the necessary design calculations to determine component values such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors based on your target cutoff frequency, gain, and bandwidth. Use standard filter design formulas or equations
derived from circuit analysis to justify your choices.
3. Simulation: Simulate the circuit on PSpice (or any equivalent tool) to verify your calculations, visualize the frequency response, and confirm that the design meets your specifications before moving to hardware implementation.
4. Implementation: Build your designed filter circuit on hardware using a breadboard, Veroboard, or PCB. Ensure neat wiring, correct component placement, and proper grounding. Once assembled, test the circuit’s performance using lab instruments such as a function generator and oscilloscope.
Record important parameters, including cutoff frequency, gain, attenuation, and bandwidth. Compare these measured results with your theoretical and simulated values to evaluate the circuit’s accuracy and performance, and document it.
5. Challenges and Troubleshooting: Lastly, discuss what challenges were faced during the design process and how they were resolved.
6. Report: Prepare a clear written report. Highlight your problem, design choices, results, comparisons, analysis, and what you learned. Refer to the report format.
o Presenting findings effectively during the final evaluation
